Final Project Proposal

To begin the final project for this course, we are asking each of you or your groups to present (in writing) a proposal for your project.
While not a major component of the project grade-wise, the proposal is critically important in order to create a rough framework of your
thoughts about what you might want to do.
For your proposal, we would like to see you consider and discuss the following:

What you would like your database to be about (what you want to store in your database)?
My database will be a medical insurance database.

How many tables do you think this database might contain
My database will contain 5-8 relations.

How much data are you planning to load into this database?
I plan to insert at least 10 records per relation.

Why is using a database to handle this data useful?
Relational databases are important for insurance companies due to their ACID properties that help support a stable structure and consistency.

How would people access this data once your project is complete?
Through a web application. I plan on using this project as a job portfolio piece so allowing outside access will be helpful for showcasing.

How do you plan to get access to all of your data?
I plan on coming up with my data myself and through some research for medical procedures that will be stored in the database.
