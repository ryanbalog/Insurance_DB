# Insurance_DB
Final Project for IST 210

The objective of this project is to show what I have learned about relational databases to create an insurance database. This insurance database will just scratch the surface of what an enterprise level insurance database would hold. I decided to use MySQL as the DBMS, MySQL Workbench to draw the E-R diagram, and Atom as my text editor.
